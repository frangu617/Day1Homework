# Homework for day 1

Changed it so it takes user input for the pack() function and eat_lunch() function.

For pack() it'll take 3 items as input.

For eat_lunch() it'll take as many inputs as the user gives it, asking in between each if there is more. When the user says (n)o it'll stop taking inputs and run the function as required by the assignment
